This is where I keep my projects that I really like and have learned important stuff from. These projects show off what I can do and what I've learned. I've worked hard on each one, and they're like my trophies. So, when you look at them, you'll see the cool things I've done and the lessons I've learned. Take a look and see what I'm all about!


## Project 1: Employee Turnover Reduction
In my role within the human capital department of a prominent corporation, I addressed a pressing concern: high employee turnover. The Board's apprehension prompted our team to embark on a mission to understand the underlying causes and propose effective retention strategies.

## Project Details
- **Data Analysis:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis, utilizing diverse data sources to gain insights into employee churn patterns.
- **Findings:** Our research revealed the main reasons behind employee turnover, giving us a better understanding of the issue.
- **Recommendations:** We applied our findings to develop practical strategies for reducing employee turnover and enhancing organizational stability.

## Project 2(guided): Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats
In this project, I conducted an A/B test to assess player retention over 1 day and 7 days, while examining the impact of variations at "gate_30" and "gate_40." The analysis aimed to determine if these variations influenced player engagement and retention, providing insights for game design decisions

## Project Details(guided)
**Methodology:**
- Bootstrap Resampling:
 Generated multiple resampled datasets to assess the variability in player retention.
 Focused on comparing player retention rates between "gate_30" and "gate_40" variations
**Analysis:**
- Calculated the Difference in Means:
   - Computed the difference in player retention means for "gate_30" and "gate_40" variations.
   - Assessed if the observed difference was statistically significant.
**Result:**
- Found:
  - Variability in player retention across samples.
  - Significantly higher player retention at "gate_30" compared to "gate_40."
